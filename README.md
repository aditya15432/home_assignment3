The assignment includes five tasks covering modern deep learning and NLP concepts:

1.Character-Level Text Generation with LSTM

Built an RNN using TensorFlow to predict the next character in a Shakespeare-like dataset.

Implemented temperature scaling to control creativity in generated text.

2. Basic NLP Preprocessing Pipeline

Performed tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming on a given sentence using NLTK and spaCy.

3. Named Entity Recognition (NER)

Used spaCy to extract named entities, their labels, and character spans from a sentence.

4. Scaled Dot-Product Attention

Implemented attention mechanism from scratch using NumPy.

Demonstrated the computation of attention scores and context vectors.

5. Sentiment Analysis with HuggingFace Transformers

Used a pre-trained transformer pipeline to detect sentiment in a product review sentence.
